								<p>My time at Clark's was mostly a forward facing position in a sales team where I had to regularly deal with the public, including small children. This came in the form of talking to customers both in store and over the phone.</p>
								<p> I was also left in charge of the store's stock room for extended periods of time. Through this I gained the skills necessary to be able to work alongside a team, while still being able to work independently.
